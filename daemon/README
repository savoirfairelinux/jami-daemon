Introduction
------------

SFLPhone is a Voice-over-IP software phone. We want it to be:
- user friendly (fast, sleek, easy to learn interface)
- professional grade (transfers, holds, optimal audio quality)
- fully compatible with Asterisk (SIP and IAX protocols)
- customizable

As the SIP/audio daemon and the user interface are separate processes,
it is easy to provide different user interfaces. SFLPhone comes with
a GTK graphical user interface and even scripts to control the daemon from
the shell.

SFLPhone is currently used by the support team of Savoir-Faire Linux Inc.

More information is available on the project homepage:
  http://www.sflphone.org/


Short description of content of source tree
-------------------------------------------

- src/ is the core of SFLphone. It contains main.cpp, the entry point and
  managerimpl.cpp.
  The ManagerImpl class is the intermediary between all the layers of the daemon.
- src/client/dbus, the D-Bus xml interfaces, and c++ bindings
- src/client/android, the JNI interfaces (Java bindings)

How to compile
--------------

# Compile the PJSIP library
cd libs
./compile_pjsip.sh

Note that pjsip need not be installed, just built in-tree.

# Then the daemon
cd ../..
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

# And the GNOME client
cd sflphone-client-gnome
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

Done !

Clang compatibility (developers only)
-------------------------------------

It is possible to compile sflphone with Clang by setting CC and CXX variables
to 'clang' and 'clang++' respectively when calling ./configure.

Currently it is not possible to use the DBus interface mechanism, and the
interaction between daemon and client will not work; for each platform where
dbus is not available the client should implement all the methods in the
*_stub.cpp files.

Note that you need a recent version of ucommon (>= 6.0.0) and of ccrtp
compiled against it to use clang.

SIP/IAx2 accounts
---------------------

You may register an existing SIP/IAX2 account through the account wizard in both clients (KDE and GNOME).
By doing this, you will be able to call other accounts known to this server.
