/**

The G.722 module is a bit exact implementation of the ITU G.722 specification for all three
specified bit rates - 64000bps, 56000bps and 48000bps. It passes the ITU tests.

To allow fast and flexible interworking with narrow band telephony, the encoder and decoder
support an option for the linear audio to be an 8k samples/second stream. In this mode the
codec is considerably faster, and still fully compatible with wideband terminals using G.722.
