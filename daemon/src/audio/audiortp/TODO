Tested and Working
-------
* Opus
* PCMU
* PCMA
* speex narrowband
* G722
* Mono and stereo input

Needs to be implemented
-----------------------
* SRTP
* DTMF over RTP
* RTP + STUN
* Rename Video{Encoder,Decoder} to AV{Encoder,Decoder}
* Drop CCRTP and its dependencies and its dependents for real

Needs to be fixed:
------------------
* speex wideband fails with "Invalid data found when processing input"
* speex ultraband fails with "Invalid data found when processing input"

Might work if libavcodec is built with support for it (untested):
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* ILBC
* g726

Can't work:
-----------
* gsm
* g729
* libavformat is MISSING RTP mux/demux for gsm and g729, see is_supported(enum AVCodecID id) in libavformat/rtpenc.c
