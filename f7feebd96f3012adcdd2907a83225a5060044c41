      "message": "I think there is technically a race condition here. If the DRT goes from disconnected to connected and then back to disconnected, then the callback will be called twice, the first time with `ok \u003d\u003d true` and the second time with `ok \u003d\u003d false`. The expected result is that `stopTracking` will be called first and `startTracking` second, but the thread pool doesn\u0027t guarantee this, and in theory `stopTracking` could end up being called after `startTracking`, resulting in an incorrect state (conversation where the DRT has no connected nodes but members aren\u0027t tracked).",
