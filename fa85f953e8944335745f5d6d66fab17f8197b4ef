After all, GNU Guile is the extension/scripting tool of choice for GNU, and it\u0027s a clean and powerful language to work with.\n\nApart from my grammar nazi spam (sorry!), I\u0027d like the bindings to the agent vs bindings to libjami approach to be discussed, as I feel like the later would be more general/valuable.\n\nThanks!",
