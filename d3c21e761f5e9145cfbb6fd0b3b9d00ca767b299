      "message": "\u003e Futur work could give the user the choice of which audio source to use as echo cancelation.\n\nCould you please make it possible that a user can have opt-in settings to permanently disable noise suppression and/or echo cancellation (maybe both - so one can be turned on the other can be turned off) - so if you want to stream music from a \"microphone\" such as a virtual soundcard - for example I want to compose music and show this process other participants - no sound will be changed?",

      "message": "Great - Therefore it would be very useful if the developers would add a UI like \"advanced audio settings\" that can be used on all apps and OS (Desktop, Android, iOS and Web). So for example: \"Advanced auido settings\" - enable noise reduction on/off - enable echo cancellation on /off etc. - so you dont have to edit any file manually.",
