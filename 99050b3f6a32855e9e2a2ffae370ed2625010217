      "message": "Not a leak as the memory pool will be released anyway, but the TURN will have a socket opened until it timeout. But anyway if it takes more than 3 secs to close, there is a problem and it will be bad to have a daemon still opened for a long time. But we should avoid to have potential infinite loop in destructors.\n\nI saw the destruction blocked twice (I ran the test 30 times) by running the test in https://review.jami.net/c/ring-daemon/+/19231/2. One in handleEvents, the second in siptransportbroker\n\nHowever I didn\u0027t save the backtraces..",
