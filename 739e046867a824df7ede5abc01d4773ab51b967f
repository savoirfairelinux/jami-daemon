      "message": "It would be great to include this option in `cx.rin.Ring.ConfigurationManager.xml` alongside the others, and to update the comment in `jamiaccount.h`:\n```\n/**\n * Update the profile vCard and send it to peers\n * @param displayName Current or new display name\n * @param avatar Current or new avatar\n * @param flag  0 for path to avatar, 1 for base64 avatar\n */\n```\n\nAdditionally, do you think it would be logical to implement this for sipaccount as well, to maintain consistency in options, even though SIP accounts do not synchronize profiles?",
