These are translation files for GNOME.

If you want to update the translations, refer to https://translations.launchpad.net/sflphone/trunk
To merge changes from launchpad, simply request a download of launchpad-export.tgz, move it to gnome/po,
and execute ./update_translation.sh

DO NOT EDIT THESE PO FILES since they are to be replaced by the new ones from launchpad. All changes might be lost.
