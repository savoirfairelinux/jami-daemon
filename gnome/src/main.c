/** @mainpage SFLphone GTK+ Client Documentation
 * SFLphone GTK+ Client was started as a debuging tool for the new dbus API but
 * ended being a full featured client.
 * @section intro_sec Architecture
 * SFLphone respects the MVC principle.  Since the internal workings and the UI
 * are too different programs, dbus is used to exchange data between them.  Dbus
 * is thereby inforcing MVC by only allowing access to high level functions and data.
 *
 * Therefore, when a button is clicked, a direct dbus API call should happen
 * (defined in dbus.h).  The UI should only be updated when signals are received
 * from dbus.  The call back to those signals are defined in dbus.c, but they call
 * functions in actions.h.  This makes things cleaner as one signal could have many
 * actions.
 *
 * Accounts are stored in form of a account_t in an account list with access functions
 * defined in accountlist.h.
 *
 * Calls are stored in form of a call_t in a call list with access functions defined
 * in calllist.h.

/** @file marshaller.h
 * @brief This file contains marshallers functions for dbus signals.
 * This file is generated by glib-genmarshall.
 * Every dbus signal has to have a marshaller.  To generate a new marshaller function,
 * add its signature to the marshaller.list.  Then run :
 * <pre>glib-genmarshal --body --g-fatal-warnings marshaller.list > marshaller.c
 * glib-genmarshal --header --g-fatal-warnings marshaller.list > marshaller.h</pre>
 * to get the generated marshallers.
 * Just before connecting to the dbus signal, register the marshaller with:
 * dbus_g_object_register_marshaller().

/** @file callmanager-glue.h, configurationmanager-glue.h, contactmanager-glue.h
 * @brief CallManager, ConfigurationManager and ContactManager dbus APIs.
 * These files are generated by dbus-binding-tool using the server's files named *-introspec.xml:
 * <pre>dbus-binding-tool --mode=glib-client "../../src/dbus/callmanager-introspec.xml" > callmanager-glue.h</pre>

 * <pre>dbus-binding-tool --mode=glib-client "../../src/dbus/contactmanager-introspec.xml" > contactmanager-glue.h</pre>
 * These files dbus call wrapper functions to simplify access to dbus API.
