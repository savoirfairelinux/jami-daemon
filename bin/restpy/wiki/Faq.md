* Why not integrate a C++ RESTful server?

    The eligible libraries are listed in the [ring-for-the-web](https://github.com/sevaivanov/ring-for-the-web/tree/master/Server/Cpp#libraries) repository. It turns out that there are not many possibilities. Restbed seemed the most promising one, but would it still be efficient on the long run? The disadvantage of using Cython is that it takes more time to rewrite the interfaces to wrap them with Python, but once it is done, the maintenance is minimal and adjustments can be made very quickly. Cython was created 8 years ago (2007) and Python, in 1991. They are therefore more mature than our best choices of C++ frameworks. It makes it a lot less likely that everything would go south on the internals. Fast-development opens the door to a lot of possibilities. For instance, unit and integration tests could be implemented to test the core of the Ring project with complex User Stories in no time. Benchmarks using build-in Python timing libraries are also there. Additionally, implementing in a High-Level language wouldn't make changing a REST framework a whole new mission. It would also be possible to write custom APIs of all kinds for different requirements. Finally, Cython allows to externalize parts of code directly in C / C++, which provides strictly objectively the best of both worlds.
