If we can reinvite without restarting the media, why not using the standard ?",

SIP is made of dozens of RFCs, so I can\u0027t guess which one you are referring to.\nBut I can answer the question partially. The SDP is still responsible for media direction. This method only implements the app logic. \nIt was decided that only the mute video requires a re-invite. Although I do not necessarily find it problematic, by I did not find any justification for that. May be you can enlighten me. I did not change it because I do not see the need to. In addition, changing it should be done through an explicit requirement.\nThis method implements the app logic and avoid hard-coding the app logic in the SDP.",
