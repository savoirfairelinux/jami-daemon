plugin.yml
----------

The test configuration file can specify:

* jplDirectory - relative to the test executable or a full path;

* plugin - the plugin name;

* mediaHandlers - present media handlers names in the plugin;

* chatHandlers - present chat handlers names in the plugin;

The default test plugin is TestSuite.

Test plugin build
-----------------

For the CI tests, which uses a Ubuntu 20.04 docker, the test suite must be build with an appropriate glibc version, meaning a glib 3.31 or older.

Jami supports systems from Ubuntu 18.04, which uses glib 2.27.

If the plugin is build within a Ubuntu 18.04, it should work on all Jami supported platforms.

TO check your system glib version: `ldd --version`
