  # For interactive proof systems there are other characters:
  # Merlin provides answers, and Arthur asks questions.
  # Merlin has unbounded computational ability (like the wizard Merlin).
  # In interactive proof systems, Merlin claims the truth of a statement, and Arthur (like King Arthur), questions him to verify the claim.
  #
  # Arthur is the "left", "black", or "vertical" player, and Bertha is the "right", "white", or "horizontal" player in a combinatorial game.
  # Additionally, Arthur, given the same outcome, prefers a game to take the fewest moves, while Bertha prefers a game to take the most moves.
