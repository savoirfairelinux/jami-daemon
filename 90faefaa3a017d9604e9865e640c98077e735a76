      "message": "On gnulinux, the error is `CMake 3.12 or higher is required.  You are running version 3.10.2`. Could we update the CMake version?\n\nFor osx, ios, android-x86_64 and android-armv7, it mentions undefined symbols while compiling GnuTLS. I\u0027m thinking it could be related problems. Android also mentions something about `Could not find a package configuration file provided by \"yaml-cpp\"`, don\u0027t know if it could be related.\n\nlibdatachannel needs either GnuTLS or OpenSSL as a dependency. I failed to make it work locally with openSSL (that\u0027s why I\u0027ve not tried pushing it). Is there one of the two I should favor trying to make work?\n\nmsvc shows \"SUCCESS\", but I don\u0027t expect it to work since the package.json does not do anything to download the submodules.",
