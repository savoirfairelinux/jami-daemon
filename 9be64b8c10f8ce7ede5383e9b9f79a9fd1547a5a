      "message": "Hello Ovari,\n\nYes it is true that the official windows distribution of ONNX has a default active telemetry but that is not the case here. We do not use their distribution, we build our own and in that process the telemetry flag is not set, thus there is no telemetry build for the onnx library used in the plugins.",
