                      scenario, if they do not have a 'milliseconds' section.
                      Default value is 0 and default unit is milliseconds.

                      Each line corresponds to one call and has one or more
                      ';' delimited data fields. Those fields can be referred
                      as [field0], [field1], ... in the xml scenario file. 
                      Several CSV files can be used simultaneously (syntax:

                      Use this option together with '-t ui'

   -l               : Set the maximum number of simultaneous calls. Once this
                      limit is reached, traffic is decreased until the number
                      of open calls goes down. Default:

   -max_socket      : Set the max number of sockets to open simultaneously.
                      This option is significant if you use one socket per

                      - On UDP retransmission timeout, abort the call by
                        sending a BYE or a CANCEL
                      - On receive timeout with no ontimeout attribute, abort
                        the call by sending a BYE or a CANCEL

                      - On unexpected CANCEL send a 200 OK and close the call
                      - On unexpected PING send a 200 OK and continue the call
                      - On any other unexpected message, abort the call by
                        sending a BYE or a CANCEL
                      

   -nr              : Disable retransmission in UDP mode.

                      bechanged during test by pressing '+','_','*' or '/'.
                      Default is 10.
                      pressing '+' key to increase call rate by 1 *
                      rate_scale,
                      pressing '-' key to decrease call rate by 1 *
                      rate_scale,
                      pressing '*' key to increase call rate by 10 *
                      rate_scale,
                      pressing '/' key to decrease call rate by 10 *
                      rate_scale.
                      If the -rp option is used, the call rate is calculated
                      with the period in ms given by the user.

   -rp              : Specify the rate period for the call rate.  Default is 1
                      second and default unit is milliseconds.  This allows
                      you to have n calls every m milliseconds (by using -r n
                      -rp m).
                      Example: -r 7 -rp 2000 ==> 7 calls every 2 seconds.
                               -r 10 -rp 5s => 10 calls every 5 seconds.

   -rate_increase   : Specify the rate increase every -fd units (default is
                      seconds).  This allows you to increase the load for each
                      independent logging period.
                      Example: -rate_increase 10 -fd 10s
                        ==> increase calls by 10 every 10 seconds.

   -rate_max        : If -rate_increase is set, then quit after the rate
                      reaches this value.
                      Example: -rate_increase 10 -rate_max 100
                        ==> increase calls by 10 until 100 cps is hit.

   -no_rate_quit    : If -rate_increase is set, do not quit after the rate
                      reaches -rate_max.

   -recv_timeout    : Global receive timeout. Default unit is milliseconds. If
                      the expected message is not received, the call times out
                      and is aborted.

   -send_timeout    : Global send timeout. Default unit is milliseconds. If a
                      message is not sent (due to congestion), the call times
                      out and is aborted.

                      the messages.

                      by -mp are echoed to their sender.
                      RTP/UDP packets coming on this port + 2 are also echoed
                      to their sender (used for sound and video echo).

   -rtt_freq        : freq is mandatory. Dump response times every freq calls
                      in the log file defined by -trace_rtt. Default value is

   -ap              : Set the password for authentication challenges. Default
                      is 'password

   -tls_cert        : Set the name for TLS Certificate file. Default is
                      'cacert.pem

   -tls_key         : Set the name for TLS Private Key file. Default is
                      'cakey.pem'

   -tls_crl         : Set the name for Certificate Revocation List file. If not
                      specified, X509 CRL is not activated.

   -3pcc            : Launch the tool in 3pcc mode ("Third Party call
                      control"). The passed ip address is depending on the
                      3PCC role.
                      - When the first twin command is 'sendCmd' then this is
                        the address of the remote twin socket.  SIPp will try to
                        connect to this address:port to send the twin command
                        (This instance must be started after all other 3PCC
                        scenarii).
                          Example: 3PCC-C-A scenario.
                      - When the first twin command is 'recvCmd' then this is
                        the address of the local twin socket. SIPp will open
                        this address:port to listen for twin command.
                          Example: 3PCC-C-B scenario.

   -tdmmap          : Generate and handle a table of TDM circuits.
                      A circuit must be available for the call to be placed.
                      Format: -tdmmap {0-3}{99}{5-8}{1-31}

   -key             : keyword value
                      Set the generic parameter named "keyword" to "value".

   -set             : variable value
                      Set the global variable parameter named "variable" to
                      "value".

   -dynamicStart    : variable value
                      Set the start offset of dynamic_id varaiable

   -dynamicMax      : variable value
                      Set the maximum of dynamic_id variable     

   -dynamicStep     : variable value
                      Set the increment of dynamic_id variable

Signal handling:

   SIPp can be controlled using posix signals. The following signals
   are handled:
   USR1: Similar to press 'q' keyboard key. It triggers a soft exit
         of SIPp. No more new calls are placed and all ongoing calls
         are finished before SIPp exits.
         Example: kill -SIGUSR1 732
   USR2: Triggers a dump of all statistics screens in
         <scenario_name>_<pid>_screens.log file. Especially useful 
         in background mode to know what the current status is.
         Example: kill -SIGUSR2 732

Exit code:

   Upon exit (on fatal error or when the number of asked calls (-m
   option) is reached, sipp exits with one of the following exit
   code:
    0: All calls were successful
    1: At least one call failed
   97: exit on internal command. Calls may have been processed
   99: Normal exit without calls processed
   -1: Fatal error


Example:

   Run sipp with embedded server (uas) scenario:
     ./sipp -sn uas
   On the same host, run sipp with embedded client (uac) scenario
     ./sipp -sn uac 127.0.0.1
