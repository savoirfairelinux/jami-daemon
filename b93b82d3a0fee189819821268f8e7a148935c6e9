      "message": "Fixed. Now builds with both ffmpeg 4.4 and 5.0.\n\nI do not know ffmpeg, so can\u0027t rebase the patches easily.\n\nArch linux use ffmpeg 5.0 for Jami for 1+ month already, and no issues were reported. Personally can confirm that at least one-to-one video calls work fine.\n\nThe benefit from this patch is that it allows to build the daemon with ffmpeg 5.0 correctly (Arch linux use -fpermissive to suppress build errors).",
