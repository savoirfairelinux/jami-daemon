Also why floor ?\nIf the loss is higher than 10, do we want it to be reduced toward 10?\nThis should be made explicit. (maybe with consts like OPUS_LOSS_MIN etc.)\n\nIf we want Opus to use a minimum of 5% of loss for FEC, maybe it should be in sender_-\u003esetPacketLoss in the Opus-specific part ?",
