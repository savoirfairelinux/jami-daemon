CREATING MANPAGES

Procedure:

 - Creating the manual pages under POD format. A template is available in this directory.
 - Convert the pod file into a manpage file:
     pod2man --section=1 --release=$(VERSION) --center "" myapp.pod > myapp.1
 - You are done! You can read the manpage file with:
     groff -man -Tascii myapp.1
