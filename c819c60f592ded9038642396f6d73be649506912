      "message": "Mohamed, I think that would make sense.\n\nSÃ©b, I did mainly mean Debian and its derivatives.  They actually have 202101 (January 2021), not 202111 (November 2021).  And that\u0027s both for sid/unstable and for bullseye/stable.\n\nAs far as I can remember, 202101 is before we merged Swarm.  I know at least for client-gnome (what Debian has) we did the adaptation to Swarm changes around June/July 2021, and that is sadly not in Debian, not even in sid/unstable.\n\nI propose we maintain this backward compatibility until the next Debian stable release, and hopefully by that time we will have been able to package latest client-qt for them. :)",
