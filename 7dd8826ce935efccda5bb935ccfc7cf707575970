      "message": "It was not that clean. The map was partly filled in the base class and the rest in the derived class. Furthermore, the fields in the \"details\" map need to be revisited to be inline with the multi-stream feature. For example, VIDEO/AUDIO_MUTED flags do not make much sense. Instead, we need to report a vector of media with their respective attributes.\nSo, I believe it\u0027s best to keep everything in the derived class.",

      "message": "It was cleaner than the current change. Call properties are filled by the call, SipCall properties are filled by the SipCall. It\u0027s ok to change the call properties according to the needs of this change. This is a common pattern, for instance during serialization of Activity data on Android, a bundle is filled by parent classes, then by child classes.",
