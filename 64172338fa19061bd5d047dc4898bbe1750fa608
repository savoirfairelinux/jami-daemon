Or the issue in the commit message?\n\nBecause setFrameSize() doesn\u0027t use mtx_ and I think width_ and height_ should be protected.\n\nI guess the client is relocking into DRing::VideoSignal::DecodingStarted\u0027s callback? Maybe this should be moved into a unlocked session.\n\nAlso, in SinkClient::setFrameSize, started_ is set after the signal. Is this really wanted? cause the flag can be in a weird state if used in a callback",
