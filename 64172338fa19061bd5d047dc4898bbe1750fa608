      "message": "can you detail the lock? Or the issue in the commit message?\n\nBecause setFrameSize() doesn\u0027t use mtx_ and I think width_ and height_ should be protected.\n\nI guess the client is relocking into DRing::VideoSignal::DecodingStarted\u0027s callback? Maybe this should be moved into a unlocked session.\n\nAlso, in SinkClient::setFrameSize, started_ is set after the signal. Is this really wanted? cause the flag can be in a weird state if used in a callback",

      "message": "* There was no lock at all in SinkClient before recently. The general assumption is that the SinkClient is fed Frames by a single daemon thread (typically the decoder thread).\n* The lock was added to protect the target (ie. the target_ variable), to allow the daemon to push a frame and the client to register/unregister a target at the same time.\n* However, setFrameSize(0, 0) -\u003e DecodingStopped causes the Android client to unregister a target synchronously, which is wanted, but causes a deadlock.\n* setFrameSize doesn\u0027t use target_ at all, so it can be called without the mutex locked. Unlike target_, width and height can\u0027t be accessed by the client.",
