 
If we need to update translations files, do the following steps:

	xgettext --c++ --kde -ktr2i18n -o sflphone-client-kde.pot ../src/*.cpp ../src/*.h ../build/src/*.h ../build/src/*.cpp

This command will update the template file with the current source files.
To be able to add strings from the ui files, and other non-c++ files which generates some c++ source, you have to first build and make the project in build directory (see the INSTALL file in root directory sflphone-client-kde).

	for fichier in `find  .  -name *.po `  ;  do  msgmerge --update $fichier sflphone-client-kde.pot  ;  done
	
This command will update the po files in every subdirectory with the new pot file.
You will then be able to translate the new strings in each po file.
