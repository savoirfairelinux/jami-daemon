      "message": "Surely it can be merged, but since a half of tests are failed, it is not very useful for regular users like me. I think the tests that should succeed without a special test enviroment should be grouped into a suite, so the call `meson test --suite local` can actually reveal regressions. What do you think? If you describe prerequisites and expected results for all tests, I will do it later.",
