Introduction
------------

Jami is a Voice-over-IP software phone. We want it to be:
- user friendly (fast, sleek, easy to learn interface)
- professional grade (transfers, holds, optimal audio quality)
- compatible with Asterisk (using SIP account)
- decentralized call (P2P-DHT)
- customizable

As the SIP/audio daemon and the user interface are separate processes,
it is easy to provide different user interfaces. Jami comes with
various graphical user interfaces and even scripts to control the daemon from
the shell.

Jami is currently used by the support team of Savoir-faire Linux Inc.

More information is available on the project homepage:
  https://www.jami.net/

This source tree contains the daemon application only that handles
the business logic of Jami. UIs are located in differents repositories. See
the Contributing section for more information.


Short description of content of source tree
-------------------------------------------

- src/ is the core of libjami.
- bin/ contains applications main code.
- bin/dbus, the D-Bus XML interfaces, and C++ bindings

How to compile on Linux
-----------------------

1) Compile the dependencies first

cd contrib
mkdir native
cd native
../bootstrap
make

2) Then the jamid application

A) With Autotools (recommended)

cd ../..
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

B) With Meson

cd ../../
mkdir build
export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/contrib/`cc -dumpmachine`/bin
meson -Dpkg_config_path=`pwd`/contrib/`cc -dumpmachine`/lib/pkgconfig -Ddefault_library=static -Dinterfaces=dbus build
cd build
ninja
ninja install

Done !

Note:
If you don't want SHM to be used, you can build with `--without-dbus`

How to compile on Linux for Android
-----------------------------------

1) Download and install Android NDK
2) Compile the dependencies

export ANDROID_NDK=<NDK>
export ANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a
export ANDROID_API=29
export TOOLCHAIN=$ANDROID_NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64
export TARGET=aarch64-linux-android
export CC=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/$TARGET$ANDROID_API-clang
export CXX=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/$TARGET$ANDROID_API-clang++
export AR=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/$TARGET-ar
export LD=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/$TARGET-ld
export RANLIB=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/$TARGET-ranlib
export STRIP=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/$TARGET-strip
export PATH=$PATH:$TOOLCHAIN/bin
cd contrib
mkdir native
cd native
../bootstrap --build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu --host=$TARGET$ANDROID_API
make

3) Update directories in the file /cross-files/android_arm64_api29.txt
4) Compile the library libjami.so

cd ../../
mkdir build
meson --cross-file `pwd`/cross-files/android_arm64_api29.txt build
cd build
ninja
ninja install

Note: to build the tests add `-Dtests=true` ; or it can be enabled later with `meson --reconfigure -Dtests=true build`

How to compile on macOS
-----------------------

# These first steps are only necessary if you don't use a package manager.
cd extras/tools
./bootstrap
make
export PATH=$PATH:/location/of/ring/daemon/extras/tools/build/bin

# Or, use your favorite package manager to install the necessary tools
(macports or brew).
automake, pkg-config, libtool, gettext, yasm

# Compile the dependencies
cd contrib
mkdir native
cd native
../bootstrap
make -j

# Then the daemon
cd ../../
./autogen.sh
./configure  --without-dbus --prefix=<install_path>
make

If you want to link against libjamiclient and native client easiest way is to
add to ./configure: --prefix=<prefix_path>

Do a little dance!

How to compile in a Docker container
-----------------------

docker build --tag jami-daemon .

# To build with custom build args

```bash
docker build --tag jami-daemon --build-arg config_args="--with-nodejs" .
```


Common Issues
-------------

autopoint not found: When using Homebrew, autopoint is not found even when
gettext is installed, because symlinks are not created.
Run: 'brew link --force gettext' to fix it.


Clang compatibility (developers only)
-------------------------------------

It is possible to compile jamid with Clang by setting CC and CXX variables
to 'clang' and 'clang++' respectively when calling ./configure.

Currently it is not possible to use the DBus interface mechanism, and the
interaction between daemon and client will not work; for each platform where
D-Bus is not available the client should implement all the methods in the
*_stub.cpp files.


SIP accounts
---------------------

You may register an existing SIP account through the account wizard in both
clients (KDE and GNOME).
By doing this, you will be able to call other accounts known to this server.
