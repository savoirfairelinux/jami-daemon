Introduction
------------

SFLPhone is a Voice-over-IP software phone. We want it to be:
- user friendly (fast, sleek, easy to learn interface)
- corporate grade (transfers, holds, perfect audio quality)
- fully compatible with Asterisk (SIP and IAX protocols)
- customizable 

As the SIP/audio daemon and the user interface are separate processes,
it is easy to provide different user interfaces. SFLPhone0.8 comes with
a GTK graphical user interface, an interactive command line interface,
and even scripts to control the daemon from the shell.

SFLPhone is actually used by the support team of Savoir-Faire Linux Inc.

Getting the dependencies
------------------------

Required libraries and tools:
- ccRTP >= 1.3.4 (tested with ccrtp 1.4.1)
  and Common C++ 2 >= 1.3.20 (tested with commoncpp2 1.4.1)
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnutelephony/
- libeXosip2 >= 2.2.2 (tested with eXosip2 2.2.3)
  and libosip2 >= 2.2.1 (tested with libosip2-2.2.2)
    http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/exosip/
    http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/osip/
- libxml2, libxml2-devel, pkgconfig
    usually available in distribution repositories
- autoconf

Optional libraries:
- zeroconf: (tested with mDNSResponder87)
    http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/bonjour/
- speex: codec for sound

Some of the required libraries may be downloaded from
  http://www.sflphone.org/#downloads
  or
  http://www.sflphone.org/dev/

See tools/config.sh for details

So in debian, you need:
apt-get install autoconf automake1.9 libtool libosip2-dev libexosip2-dev libccrtp-dev libcommoncpp2-dev pkg-config libsamplerate-dev libasound2-dev


Building the dependencies
-------------------------

If you do not use either the development packages of your distribution or the source packages made by the upstream authors of dependencies, you may want to try our custom dependencies building script in tools/ directory:
Note that commoncpp, ccrtp, libosip and libexosip, samplerate are in debian and fedora.

You can also compile each dependency, one by one:

1/	For commoncpp2
	./configure [option]
	make
	make install

2/	For ccrtp
	./configure [option]
	make
	make install

3/	For libosip2
	./configure [option]
	make
	make install

	Note: if you install any package in /usr/local, don't forget to set pkg-config path with:
	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/


Building SFLPhone
-----------------

./configure
make
make install (as root) 



Using SFLPhone
--------------

If you have the sflphone 0.3 or 0.4 release, copy the file sflphonerc
to sflphonedrc:
  cp ~/.sflphone/sflphonerc ~/.sflphone/sflphonedrc
If you have an older version, remove your sflphonerc file located in
$HOME/.sflphone

1. Install the GTK GUI 

2. Lauch sflphone interface, a setup window appears. 

3. If you do have a SIP account, fill the SIP stuff where related. You can
   use STUN too.

4. Save your settings, restart it. You're done.

A user's guide will be available on:
http://www.sflphone.org/doc/



What if it does not build?
--------------------------

- Try using the same versions of the libraries as we do.
  See http://www.sflphone.org in section Downloads.

- Try using the same compilers as ours: gcc 4.1.0 on Fedora Linux Core 5
  is known to work.

- If you have dependencies installed in unusual directories, try setting
  the environment variable CXXFLAGS before building, for example:
  export CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/include"



How to enable IAX support?
--------------------------

Go inside libs directory and execute ./libiax2.sh script.
Then, run ./configure with --enable-iax2 option.


Debugging SFLPhone
------------------
You can use the --with-debug option with configure
./configure --with-debug
make


Run-time troubleshooting
------------------------

- If errors occured when trying to load shared libraries, check that the
  value of the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH include the
  directories containing the required libraries, eg:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/my/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

- Portaudio don't detect your sound card because :
  * artsd is running
  * jackd is running 
    On 2005/11/22, jack wasn't working with these settings: 
    jackd -d alsa -r 8000
  * you use alsa with sflphone and another application, but dmixer isn't
    configurated correctly inside ~/.asoundrc or /etc/alsa/alsa.conf

- sflphone refuse to start because it's running
  You could have something like: "Exception: could not bind socket"
  Try to close sflphone before 
    echo "stop sflphone" | nc localhost 3999
  or
    killall sflphone


  
Short description of content of source tree
-------------------------------------------

- ringtones/ contains the different ringtones.
- stund/ is an implementation of the protocol STUN used when there is a NAT.
- utilspp/ allows to implement a singleton.
- src/ is the core of SFLphone. It contains the main.cpp, managerimpl.cpp
  files, audio and gui directories, and files about signalisation SIP. Later,
  it should be better, when IAX will be implemented, that a directory groups
  these protocols. 
  The ManagerImpl class is the intermediaire between all the layer in the tree.
- src/audio/ is the audio layer. It contains all about tones, dtmf,
  audiodriver, rtp layer, audio codec ulaw, alaw and gsm.
- src/audio/gsm/ contains the implementation of gsm audiocodec library.
- src/audio/pacpp/ implements PortAudioCpp, a native C++ binding of 
  PortAudio V19. (remove in sflphone 0.7)
- src/gui/ is the old directory that contains all about different user
  interface.
- src/gui/server is the directory that talk (tcp socket on port 3999) to
  sflphone client. The slfphone client can be a console program or a graphical
  interface.

		|    SIP    |       |  IAX  |
		|    RTP    |       +-------+
		|   STUN    |
		+-----------+

It's in ManagerImpl where we declared Call vector and VoIPLink vector.
VoIPLink vector contains all different VoIP link like SIP, IAX, ...
Call vector contains all the calls according to the kind of VoIP link.
