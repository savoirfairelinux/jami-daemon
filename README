Introduction
------------

GNU Ring is a Voice-over-IP software phone. We want it to be:
- user friendly (fast, sleek, easy to learn interface)
- professional grade (transfers, holds, optimal audio quality)
- compatible with Asterisk (using SIP account)
- decentralized call (P2P-DHT)
- customizable

As the SIP/audio daemon and the user interface are separate processes,
it is easy to provide different user interfaces. GNU Ring comes with
various graphical user interfaces and even scripts to control the daemon from
the shell.

GNU Ring is currently used by the support team of Savoir-faire Linux Inc.

More information is available on the project homepage:
  https://www.jami.net/

This source tree contains the daemon application only, DRing, that handles
the business logic of GNU Ring. UIs are located in differents repositories. See
the Contributing section for more information.


Short description of content of source tree
-------------------------------------------

- src/ is the core of DRing.
- bin/ contains applications main code.
- bin/dbus, the D-Bus XML interfaces, and C++ bindings
- bin/restcpp, the C++ REST API implemented with Restinio

How to compile on Linux
-----------------------

1) Compile the dependencies first

cd contrib
mkdir native
cd native
../bootstrap
make

2) Then the dring application

cd ../../
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

Done !

More details available here:
https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/technical/Build-instructions


How to compile on OSX
---------------------

# These first steps are only necessary if you don't use a package manager.
cd extras/tools
./bootstrap
make
export PATH=$PATH:/location/of/ring/daemon/extras/tools/build/bin

# Or, use your favorite package manager to install the necessary tools
(macports or brew).
automake, pkg-config, libtool, gettext, yasm

# Compile the dependencies
cd contrib
mkdir native
cd native
../bootstrap
make -j

# Then the daemon
cd ../../
./autogen.sh
./configure  --without-dbus --prefix=<install_path>
make

If you want to link against libringclient and native client easiest way is to
add to ./configure: --prefix=<prefix_path>

Do a little dance!


Common Issues
-------------

autopoint not found: When using Homebrew, autopoint is not found even when
gettext is installed, because symlinks are not created.
Run: 'brew link --force gettext' to fix it.


Clang compatibility (developers only)
-------------------------------------

It is possible to compile dring with Clang by setting CC and CXX variables
to 'clang' and 'clang++' respectively when calling ./configure.

Currently it is not possible to use the DBus interface mechanism, and the
interaction between daemon and client will not work; for each platform where
D-Bus is not available the client should implement all the methods in the
*_stub.cpp files.

How to compile with the REST API
--------------------------------

GNU Ring offers two REST API. One written in C++, and the other written in Cython.
Up to this date, only the C++ API is available. The Cython API will soon follow.

To compile Ring-daemon with the C++ REST API, follow these two steps :

1) Compile the dependencies
cd contrib
mkdir native
cd native
../bootstrap
make

2) Then compile the daemon
cd ../../
./autogen.sh
./configure --without-dbus --with-restcpp
make

SIP accounts
---------------------

You may register an existing SIP account through the account wizard in both
clients (KDE and GNOME).
By doing this, you will be able to call other accounts known to this server.
