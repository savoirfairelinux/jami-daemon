/**
 * @file noncopyable.h
 * @brief Simple macro to hide class' copy constructor and assignment operator.
 *        Useful to avoid shallow copying (i.e. classes with pointer members)
 *        Usage: For a class named MyClass, the macro call
 *        NON_COPYABLE(MyClass) should go in the private section of MyClass
 *        WARNING: Since C++11 using this macro make the class also non-movable by default!
 *        You shall re-implement yourself (or at least using declare with =default)
 *        move-constructor and move-assignable function members if they are needed.
