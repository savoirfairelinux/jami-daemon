Installing Apple mDNSResponder:

WARNING: this is NOT Howl's mDNSResponder and it does not come in Debian package called mdnsresponder.
You can see the difference by checking daemon's name: Apple's one (the correct one) is named 'mdnsd'
Howl's one is named 'mDNSResponder'.

1) download mDNSResponder 
 - from Apple site (http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl/mDNSResponder-98.tar.gz)
 - or you can get tarball from: http://helios.et.put.poznan.pl/~jstachow/pub/mDNSResponder-98.tar.gz
    (for those who don't like registration)
 - you can also use the last mDNSResponder
   like http://helios.et.put.poznan.pl/~jstachow/pub/mDNSResponder-107.1.tar.gz

2) compile and install
 Build system for mDNSResponder is quite weird so here are instructions:
 
 cd mDNSPosix
 make os=linux             (make without parameters gives list of supported systems)
 now as root:
 make os=linux install
 
 make sure that mdnsd.sh init script is properly installed and will be executed at boot time
