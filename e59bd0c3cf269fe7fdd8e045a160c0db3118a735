      "message": "1. Should `voice` activity be changed to `audio` indicator?\n\nA superset which contains voice is audio/sound.\n\nThere are scenarios where there is no voice; however, there is audio/sound.\n\nExamples were there is audio, but no voice are:\na) a music teacher is playing an instrument, eg guitar\nb) streaming animal watchers, eg listening to birds, bird watchers\n\n2. Should variable be changed from a boolean to an integer?\n\nIf the value is zero `0`, then there is no audio activity.\n\nThe range from 1 to 10 indicates the intensity. This can then be used to show an audio intensity indicator around the tile of the stream transmitting the audio/sound.\n\n3. Will each user have a toggle to enable/disable the audio indicator?\n\nThank you",

      "message": "Hello,\n\n1. This change is specifically to add voice activity detection, using WebRTC Audio Processing and Speex DSP. They specifically detect voice activity, not just audio activity. They do some signal processing and try to match it to characteristics of human speech. So, it\u0027s possible that the libraries won\u0027t detect bird calls, guitar, etc. It\u0027s not an audio level meter, but that could be a good feature to add. It could be implemented via a plugin or in the daemon itself.\n\n2. Both libraries return boolean values for voice activity. Internally, both libraries use probabilities, but they aren\u0027t publicly exposed.\n\n3. Specifics are yet to be decided. We will definitely allow people to disable voice activity detection. How the voice activity interacts with the conference video layout has also not yet been decided.\n\nThanks for the feedback",
