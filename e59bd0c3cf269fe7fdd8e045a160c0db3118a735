      "message": "1. Should `voice` activity be changed to `audio` indicator?\n\nA superset which contains voice is audio/sound.\n\nThere are scenarios where there is no voice; however, there is audio/sound.\n\nExamples were there is audio, but no voice are:\na) a music teacher is playing an instrument, eg guitar\nb) streaming animal watchers, eg listening to birds, bird watchers\n\n2. Should variable be changed from a boolean to an integer?\n\nIf the value is zero `0`, then there is no audio activity.\n\nThe range from 1 to 10 indicates the intensity. This can then be used to show an audio intensity indicator around the tile of the stream transmitting the audio/sound.\n\n3. Will each user have a toggle to enable/disable the audio indicator?\n\nThank you",
