      "message": "Hello, I have a question.\n\nJami uses SHA-1 addresses, deduced from a public key.\nI2P uses base32-encoded SHA256 addresses, deduced from signing and encryption public keys (with some additional info).\nYggdrasil uses IPv6-like addresses, deduced from a public key.\n\nAre Jami going to provide some abstraction for different addresses? I think the daemon should be built for a concrete network layer (IPv4/IPv6+DHT, I2P, raw IPv6), but clients should support any type of addresses to work correctly. For example, you can use URLs like \"sip:\u003c...\u003e\", \"jami:\u003c...\u003e\", \"i2p:\u003c...\u003e\", \"ygg:\u003c...\u003e\" as contact (and device) identifiers.",
