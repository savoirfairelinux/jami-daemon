= Gerrit Workflow =

Gerrit is used as a code review tool. It is also the primary Git repository.
Wiki documentation: https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/tutorials/Working-with-gerrit

== Commit Messages ==

Indicate the number of the related Tuleap issue in your commit message.

== commit-msg hook ==

The Gerrit commit-msg hook must be installed before code reviews can be pushed to Gerrit.
This is because Gerrit relies on a unique Change-Id that can be tracked. The commit-msg hook
takes care of inserting a Change-Id in your commit messages for you.

It can be installed in your local git repository with the following command:
$ gitdir=$(git rev-parse --git-dir); scp -p -P 29420 username@gerrit-ring.savoirfairelinux.com:hooks/commit-msg ${gitdir}/hooks/
