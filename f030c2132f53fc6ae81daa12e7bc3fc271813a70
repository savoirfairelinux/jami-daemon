      "message": "Did you measure the performance impacts of this change? I did some quick tests which suggest a ~20x slowdown in `ConversationRepository::Impl::commit`, a ~3x slowdown in the call to `git_remote_fetch` in `ConversationRepository::fetch`, and a ~15x slowdown in `ConversationRepository::Impl::mergeFastforward`. This isn\u0027t necessarily a problem given that the absolute execution times are still relatively low, but maybe it\u0027d be worth doing more rigorous benchmarks before merging this?",
