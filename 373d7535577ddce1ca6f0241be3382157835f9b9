      "message": "Cool class, but I believe not needed for this case :)\nThe map could more simply be protected by a mutex, similarly to videoInputs and audioInputs.\nAlso, all map operations are short and non-blocking, and we don\u0027t expect this map to be accessed frequently, so it\u0027s likely not a contention point and the overhead of shared read ownership is not needed.\n\nHowever, the pattern of protecting a single map with a mutex is indeed common through Jami, so it may make sense to add this class as a common utility. This could be done in a separate commit.",
